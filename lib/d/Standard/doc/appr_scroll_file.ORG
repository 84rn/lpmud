Welcome to the ranks of Genesis wizards! 



As an apprentice wizard you have but four duties:

  o Learn what rules apply to wizards,
  o Learn how to use your new wizard commands,
  o Learn about how the world of Genesis is coded, and
    (if you haven't done so already)
  o Find a Domain you want to code in.

This scroll was cloned to you when you were promoted to Apprentice rank.  
It should be a valuable resource to you in your early days of wizardhood.
Please read the paragraphs below for assistance in completing the above-
mentioned duties.



RULES
=====
Wizards have great powers.  
With those powers comes the responsibility to use them wisely.  

So that there is no confusion as to what is required of you as a wizard, 
you should:
   -"cd /d/Genesis/doc/rules/wizard" and read every file in that dir.
   -Pay particular attention to the "wizard_vs_player_policy" document 
    in that directory.  Within it are the basic rules which -all- wizards 
    must follow.

Upon joining a Domain, you may find that your Liege will have more res-
trictive rules which you are also required to follow.  Failure to obey 
the Genesis wizard rules or the Domain rules may result in your demotion 
or erasure, depending on the circumstances.


COMMANDS
========
The command "allcmd" will tell you what all your wizard commands are.  
   You may use it with an argument, as in "allcmd apprentice" and "allcmd
   wizard", which will give you the list of commands available to you in
   each rank.
      -Use "help <command>" to obtain more information about each of 
       these commands.
  
Two other important commands are "man" and "sman".
   These commands will give you quick access to manual pages covering many
   topics.  They give vital information on most functions (sman) as well 
   as guidelines, rules, and explanatory text on all major aspects of 
   Genesis (man).
      -Use "help man" and "help sman" to learn to use these commands.
      -Do "man -k general" to get a list with all the chapters available.
      -Do "man <chapter>" to read a specific chapter, or
      -Simply "cd /doc/man" and use "more" to read whichever files catch 
       your attention.

RTFM and RTFSC.
   When you ask a question of a wizard you might to get the reply: 
   RTFM (Read the F***ing Manual) or RTFSC (Read the F***ing Source Code)

   Do not become discouraged.  It is simply a reminder (however unkind) to
   you that the information you seek is in the "man" somewhere.  If you 
   cannot find the man page for the topic you want, try checking "man -k 
   general" or asking a wizard for the name of the chapter you should 
   "man" or "sman".



CODING
======
For many, the prospect of learning to code in LPC is daunting. For others,
it is an extension of their higher education, or something which comes as
naturally as breathing (these are rare wizards, indeed). 

Regardless of where you stand in the spectrum of coding ability, there
are certain files that are essential reading:
      /d/Genesis/open/legal  (info on copyright)
      /doc/man/general/LPC 
      /doc/man/general/INTRO, and 
      /doc/man/general/INTRO_RULES 

When you have read these files, you may wish to look at the code examples 
in the subdirectories under /doc/examples.

There is also an LPC tutorial accessible via the Genesis Home Page on the 
World Wide Web.  It is a work in progress, however, and may not cover every
thing you need to know.

DOMAINS
=======
Finally, you must find a Domain before you can code your ideas.  If you are 
an Apprentice who is not committed to a Domain (a rare sight these days), 
there are several ways to gather information which will help you make your 
choice:
   The Tower of Realms (/d/Genesis/wiz/domain).  
      There is an exit to it from the apprentice workroom (/doc/workroom,
      your home until you have joined a Domain). The bulletin board there, 
      together with the special domain rooms, should give you some idea of 
      what each Domain is like.  

   Use the "finger domains" command.  This will return the list of Domains 
   in Genesis. 
      -"finger <domain>" will give you information on a specific Domain: 
       Who is Liege of the domain, the number of vacancies in the domain, 
       the names of current wizards, and a small body of text describing 
       the domain.

   Read the files in /d/<Domain>/open/*, which usually contain files called
       README, HISTORY, APPLY, etc, which give (sometimes outdated) info
       on the Domain of interest. 

   Use "home <domain>" to go to that Domain's workroom and read its board.

Once you have found a Domain which interests you, you can:
   -"apply <domain>". It is probably a good idea to speak to the Liege or
	the Domain members prior to applying.
   -Mail the Liege of the Domain you are interested in.
   -Use the "applications" command to see which Domains you have applied to.
   -Use "regret <domain>" to withdraw an application to a Domain.

If you have a good idea for a new Domain, you should speak to the Arch of 
Domains.
