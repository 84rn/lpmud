NAME
	trainee - mark/unmark someone as trainee

SYNOPSYS
	trainee
	trainee a[dd] <name>
	trainee r[emove] <name>

ACCESS LEVEL
	Liege and higher. Liege may mark only members of their own domain
	as trainee.

DESCRIPTION
	With this command, full wizards may be marked as trainee. A trainee
	has the same abilities as a full wizard has, with only one
	difference. The trainee has write access to his/her home directory
	only, rather than to the whole domain, as full wizards have.

	The reason for this status is to give an apprentice domain wizard
	access only to his/her home directory and use the sanction command
	to give access to a (pilot) project directory. This way, the new
	wizard can get acquainted with his/her duties in the domain and with
	life as a domain wizard without without any risks either way. Only
	full wizards can be marked as trainee.

OPTIONS
	<none>	Generate a list of all trainees.
	<name>	The name of the wizard to mark/unmark as trainee.
	add	Add the wizard to the list of trainees.
	remove	Remove the wizard from the list of trainees.
