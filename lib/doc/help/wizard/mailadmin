NAME
	mailadmin

SYNOPSYS
	mailadmin export <player name> <filename>
	mailadmin purge
	mailadmin reset
	mailadmin rehash <new hash size>
	mailadmin stats

DESCRIPTION
	Since the mail system uses a data-structure that cannot be manipulated
	directly (as it uses hashing and individual message files), we need a
	central command to control the system. The mailadmin command can be
	used to access the central mail functionality used to administer the
	mail system. The following subcommands are provided:

     1)	mailadmin export <player name> <filename>

	This will take the mailbox of <player name> and stores all messages
	from that mailbox in the file with named <filename>. There is no
	check for eval-cost in this command, but it has been tested to work
	for mailboxes of several hundreds of messages.

     2) mailadmin purge

	This option can be used to clean the mail system and remove slack
	from it. It is advised to do this a few times a year. It will do the
	following:
	- remove all mailboxes from players that do no longer exist;
	- check all message files and remove the names of all recipients who
	  no longer exist;
	- cross check all message files with all mailboxes and remove those
	  message files that are no longer connected to any mailbox.

     3)	mailadmin reset

	Only one instance of the mailadmin command can be active at one
	time. If the command is stuck somehow, this option may be used
	to reset the module and make the mailadmin command available again.
	One should be VERY reluctant to use this option!

     4)	mailadmin rehash <new hash size>

	The individual message-files are distributed over a number of
	directories. When there are too many message-files in a directory,
	this will reduce efficiency. Therefore, when there are too many
	files in a single directory even after a purge, the message files
	can be re-distrubuted over <new hash size> directories.

     5)	mailadmin stats

	Prints various statistics about the mail system.

ARGUMENTS
	<player name>	The name of the player whose mailbox is to be
			written to file.

	<filename>	The name of the file to which the mailbox is to
			be written to.

	<new hash size>	The new hash size to be used for all message files.
			This value must be at least 10.
