MEME 
	Destruct

SYNOPSIS
	Destruct [-D] <object>

DESCRIPTION
	With this command you can destroy most objects in this game.

ARGUMENTS
	<object> - the object to destruct (for syntax: see 'help tracer')

OPTION
	-D - Will destruct the object the hard and brutal way and not via
	     remove_object(). Good when you have an error in that
	     function. Be advised that objects may have special code if
	     it is removed, so don't use -D if it isn't necessary.

SEE ALSO
	tracer
