SYNOPSIS
	unmetflag <npc>

DESCRIPTION
	If you do 'unmetflag' without argument you will get the unmet
	description of every living being when looking on them. You can
	do 'unmetflag npc' too. Then you will know all players but get the
	unmet description of all npc:s you meet. Note, that you will NOT
	know npc:s that have introduced themselves to you. 

	LIVE_I_ALWAYS_KNOWN and NEVER_KNOWN always overrules any unmet
