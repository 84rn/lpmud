DESCRIPTION
	This command simply gives you valuable information about an object.

ARGUMENTS
	<object>	The object to Dump information about.
			(for syntax: see 'help tracer')

OPTIONS
	<var>		Will print the value of 'var' in <object>

	list		Will list all objects carried by <object>

	props		Will list all properties set in <object>

	vars		Will list all variables in <object> with their
			values.

	shadows		Will list all objects shadowing <object>

	inherit		Will list all objects inherited by <object>

	flags		Will print some internal flags the driver maintains,
			together with some object status information.

	profile		Will print the objects profile statistics if the
			appropriate options are set in the driver.

	info		Will print some basic statistics about <object>

	cpu		Will display the cpu time consumed by <object>
			if the appropriate option is set in the driver.

	functions	Lists all the functions defined in <object>
			(but NOT inherited objects)

	alarms		Lists information about the alarms in <object>.

	If anybody defines one of these names for a variable, you will see
	the variable instead of the other info. To bypass this, append the
	name with an exclamation point.

EXAMPLES
	Dump *nick:#1 props	Will list all properties set in the first
				object carried by the player called Nick.

	Dump #1 list!		Lists the inventory of the first object in
				this environment, even if there is a global
				variable 'list' defined in the object.
