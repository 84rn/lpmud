NAME
	shutdown - shut the game down

SYNOPSIS
	shutdown <delay> <reason>
	shutdown now <reason>
	shutdown abort

DESCRIPTION
	With this command you tell the gamedriver to shut down. Your
	name, along with the stated reason for shutdown, is usually
	logged. This command should only be used in emergencies. It is
	better to use a delay, usually five minutes, to allow mortal
	players to sell stuff and get back to their home location.

	When the memory is almost used up, ie the memory usage is 97%
	or greater, you can ask Armageddon to shut down the game due
        to lack of memory by typing 'shutdown 5 memory_failure'. This
        reason must be typed literally. The memory is not triggered, but
        tested after an interval, so that the memory usage can well
        exceed 100% before Armageddon notices.

	Misuse = demotion.

OPTIONS
	<delay>  - the delay in minutes before the game is acutally
		   shut down.
	now	 - shut the game down without delay.
	<reason> - the reason why you shut the game down. This reason is
		   displayed to the mortals when they are notified.
	abort	 - abort a previously started shutdown sequence. If the
		   game is being shut down due to memory failure, it is
		   not possible to abort the sequence.
