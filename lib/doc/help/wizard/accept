NAME
	accept - accept an apprentice into the domain

SYNOPSIS
	accept <name>

DESCRIPTION
	With this command a Liege can accept anyone into the domain who
	has made an application. Usually this will be apprentices, but
	wizards in the independant wizard-domain can also apply to join
	a normal domain.

	The command accept can also be used by a Liege to draft a madwand
	into the domain. A madwand is a mortal player who has been made
	wizard instantly and is solely dedicated to the domain (s)he
	joined. When expelled again, a madwand reverts back to mortal.
	The mortal player does not need to apply first like apprentices.
	Arches and keepers must use the draft-command to make a mortal
	player into a wizard.

ARGUMENTS
	<name>	the name of the player to accept.
