SYNOPSIS
	More
	More <object>

DESCRIPTION

	object without having to know its filename. The contents are
	displayed in pages so they don't scroll your screen too fast.
	Just use the tracer tool argument to display the file. Use the
	command 'morelen' to set the number of lines you want to be
	displayed in one page.

ARGUMENTS
	<none>   - more the file of the room you are in.
