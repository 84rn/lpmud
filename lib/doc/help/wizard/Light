NAME
	Light

SYNOPSIS
	Light
	Light <object>

DESCRIPTION
	Display information on the light status of an object and all
	objects in its inventory. It will tell you its light status and
	whether the object generates of absorbs light.

ARGUMENTS
	<none>   - default to your environment.
	<object> - the object you want to print light information on.
		   It takes the tracer format (for syntax: 'help tracer').

EXAMPLE
	Object: /d/Wiz/mercade/workroom           : OBJ CONT ROOM

	Mercade's workroom                        :   3        +1
	   /doc/examples/spells/obj/lighter       :   1
	   Mercade                                :   1 (transp.)
	      rugsack (open)                      :   1   -1
	         large torch (lit)                :   2

	In this case, I am carrying a rugsack in which carry a lit torch
	of strength 2. The rugsack itself radiates darkness of strength -1.
	Also, I have casted a light-spell of strength 1 on the room I am
	in. The room is a basic room with default light of strength 1.
	As you see, I do neither generate nor absorb light. I am just
	transparrantly passing though the light I carry. The coins I have
	in my pocket aren't interesting from a light point of view, so
	they are disregarded.
