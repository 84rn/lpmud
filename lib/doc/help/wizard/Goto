NAME
	Goto

SYNOPSIS
	Goto <object>

DESCRIPTION
	Enter the inventory of an object.

ARGUMENTS
	<object> - the object to enter

EXAMPLES
	Goto /d/Genesis/wiz/discuss
		Go to the room with the discussion board.
	Goto *edchakom:^

ADVICE
	This command is rather obsoluete. It is much easier to use the
	command 'goto' in the apprentice soul.

WARNING
	It's possible but not recommendable to enter the inventory of a
	player. This not only causes a lot of (technical) trouble, but
	will CERTAINLY earn you a severe reprimand by any archwizard if
	he should see you doing this. If you enter the inventory of an
	archwizard you will probably be removed from the game without
	any discussion.

SEE ALSO
	tracer, goto
