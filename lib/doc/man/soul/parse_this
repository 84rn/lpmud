/*
 * Function name: parse_this
 * Defined in   : /cmd/std/command_driver.c
 * Description  : This is a parser with some extra functions and checks,
 *                specially designed for the soul. It is meant for livings,
 *                but it can be used on any items. This function will
 *                check whether this_player() can see the targets.
 * Arguments    : string str  - the command line parameters to parse
 *                string form - the parse-pattern
 * Returns      : an array of objects or an empty array.
 *
 * To use this function to parse livings in the environment of this_player()
 * do remind to add all possible prepositions and the optional article [the]
 * to the search pattern.. It might look like:
 *
 * "[the] %l"
 * "[at] [the] %l"
 * "[to] / [towards] [the] %l"
 * "[the] %l [on] [his] / [her] / [its] / [their] [head] / [heads]"
 *
 * Search patterns like the latter are used in the basic emotions soul to
 * allow players to type "pat the friendly dwarf on his head". Obviously,
 * they can also type "pat the Mercade on her heads", but that is not
 * important. The important thing of an extended parse pattern is that it
 * allows players to make "full sentences".
