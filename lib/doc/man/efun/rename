NAME
	rename - rename a file or move a subdirectory

SYNOPSIS
	int rename(string frompath, string topath)

DESCRIPTION
	Renames the file 'frompath' to the name 'topath'. This is functionally
	identical to copying the file 'frompath' to 'topath' and the remove
	'frompath'. 
	
	If 'topath' exists and is a file, it is removed.

	If 'topath' is a directory then move the file to that directory.

	If 'frompath' is a directory then move the entire subdirectory
	to 'topath'.

	Return 1 if UNSUCCESSFUL.

SEE ALSO
	rmdir, rm, mkdir

BUGS
	It should be changed to return 0 for unsuccessful move as all other
	efuns of this kind does.
