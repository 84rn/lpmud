NAME
	add_action - add an action to an object
	
SYNOPSIS
	void add_action(function fun, string verb, void|int part)

DESCRIPTION
	This function adds an action to the `living' object that
	the command is run by. `function' is the function name that
	is to be run when the command verb `verb' is given.

	If `part' is defined (not 0) only a part of the given verb
	need to be given for the command to work

	For example:

	add_action(foobar, "tele", 1);
	
	will match on "tele" or "teleledning" while the whole verb
	"teleledningsanka" will have to be given for this expression:

	add_action(foobar, "teleledningsanka", 0); or
	add_action(foobar, "teleledningsanka");

NOTA BENE
	For this action to be added to an object, the object must be
	`living', i.e. the function "enable_commands()" must have been
	performed in the object prior to the "add_action()".
