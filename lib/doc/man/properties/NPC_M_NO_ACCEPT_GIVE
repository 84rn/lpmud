NPC_M_NO_ACCEPT_GIVE            If this prop is set the npc won't accept items
                                offered to it via the give command from other
                                beings. If it's set to a string, that string
                                will be written, like QCTNAME(npc) + str.
                                This prop is set as default in all mobiles.
				If you choose to set the prop to 1 the players
				will get a 'give what to whom?' message. You can
				ofcourse set this to VBFC too and make some tests
				and so on ...
