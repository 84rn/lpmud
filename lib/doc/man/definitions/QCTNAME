*Defined in /sys/macros.h

QCTNAME(ob)	Works like QTNAME but capitalizes the name or description
		before it is printed.
		N.B. A mistake that many people make is to use this together
		     with break_string(). That will not work. This macro is
		     evaluated when it is needed, while break_string() is
		     evaluated immediately.
