*Defined in /sys/composite.h

QCNAME(ob)	Works like QNAME but it returns the name or description of
		ob capitalized.
		N.B. A mistake that many people make is to use this together
		     with break_string(). That will not work. This macro is
		     evaluated when it is needed, while break_string() is
		     evaluated immediately.
